## Skills:
- Computes multiple values in R and includes them using inline .Rmd syntax. 
- Uses `dplyr` for data wrangling
- Renders a table of aggregate data in the report.
- References values calculated in R.
- Uses `Leaflet` to build an interactive map that shows a marker at the location of each shooting. Manipulates the appearance (size, color) of the markers based on the underlying dataset (# injured, # killed). Detailed information is shown to the user when they hover over each point.
- Uses `ggplot2` to create a plot showing mass shootings by month.
